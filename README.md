This is my first project of the software engineering immersive course at GA London. The assignment was to create a grid-based game to be rendered in the browser, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project was to be completed individually within one week.

 was inspired by the classic Pac-man game. I mixed a Pac man with a super Mario. The object of the game is for Mario to catch the mushroom. 
The mushroom follows the path. 
If Mario catches the mushroom. He wins by 100 points. 
After 600 points, the mushroom has to move faster. (level 2).
